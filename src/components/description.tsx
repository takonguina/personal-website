      Since I started as a developer, I&apos;ve been passionate about building
      digital experiences that go beyond code to solve real user needs. Today, I
      work as a full-stack JavaScript developer, focused on creating mobile apps
      with React Native and Expo. Alongside development, I’m drawn to
      understanding the business challenges behind each project to design
      innovative features that make a real impact in a competitive tech
      landscape. <br />
      <br />I also have a growing interest in building and launching my own
      applications, where I can bring my ideas to life and explore new
      solutions. You can find some of these personal projects below, where I’ve
      combined technical skills with entrepreneurial drive to create products
      I’m excited to share. <br />
      <br />
      When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me learning something new or
      brainstorming the next project to dive into.
